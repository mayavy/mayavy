- 👋 Hi, I’m @mayavy,
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics, programming; like developing things that don't exist but I know they will, someone will make them, I wanna be that one.
- 🌱 I’m currently spending time on computer programming because that's the only thing that I can do on my own. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for a job related to Physics, software, STEM.
- 🧑‍💻 I have worked one year in writing codes for Atmospheric-sciences and analyzing the atmospheric data in time of COVID. (yes! it was paid position)
- 🎓 My background is in Maths, Physics and Electronics

## Every code and logic here is written/thought by me, except "forks".
